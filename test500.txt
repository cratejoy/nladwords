hello every one
how are you.
hiiiiiiiiiii.
currently, i am putting a group of investors together who have an interest in minor league baseball.  by way of introduction, i have been in the baseball business for almost 20 years as a general manager in the minor leagues.  i have started teams in the chicago area and turned around teams in nashville and other places with great success.     in this business we have been successful because of our business plan and commitment to "family fun and entertainment."  i can forward information to interested parties to give you some background and how to proceed if there is an interest on your part.  i can assure you there is great potential for a better than average return on investment and the most fun you will ever have in any investment..
i would love to see more information on what you are doing..
mr. baseball,
i sent you a private email to your mailbox about a week ago asking for more info without a reply since. where`d you go?
r@.
baseball, if you had anything to do with the kane county cougars all i can say is great job! i have enjoyed many great evenings at the ballpark watching minor league play. the fun cannot be beat. it`s a great price, the guys that play truly love the game, and you don` t have to walk a quarter of a mile to get to the men`s room....a definite bonus! if you had nothing to do with them, i still wish you the best of luck as i know what a good minor league ball park can do for an entire area. have fun with it!.
hello!  
  
    my name is
joann  my husband  and i started sweet dream children’s
interiors. in jan. sweet dream is a small custom furniture company. our focus is on
custom theme furniture for children’s rooms.  
  
  
    we recently launched our website www.sweetdreambed.com 
  
  
      in order to
start  we invest everything we had (savings, credit, even tax returns)
in the business..
you may want to look into www.prosper.com it is an alternative method of getting funding..
joann - on the heels of zipline`s message, check out our topic on prosper and the startupnation group..
joann:
sounds like you have a great product idea that is getting good acceptance.
finding capital is often a real challenge for early stage companies. however, there is really quite a lot of capital "out there". it`s usually a matter of presenting the right deal to the appropriate funding source - whether it be an institution or individual.
there are many possible options -depending upon your specific situation.
how much capital do you need?
for what purpose will it be used?
what is your long range plan for the business?
what deal you can and want to offer?plus other considerations.

hello! yes i was referred to prosper.com but because our state has limits on what somoeone can charge on interest. we aren`t able to get help.our long range plan is to hire more people to help my husband so he`s not the only one building the beds.you can email me directly at sweetdreambed@aol.comthanks.
“wow” joann what a great product you and your husband have created. let me start out by saying what you guys are experiencing is not uncommon for all new start-ups “growing pains” from what you have shared here i don’t think there is one simple answer, but there are answers, so don’t give up on your dream. 
 
from my 33 years of owning multiple businesses and my new found love of businesses coaching i would highly advise you guys to take a step back at this point. take a day off, go to a park and walk and relax, take in a (cheap) dinner and brainstorm. like the old saying goes “sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees” i think it applies to you and your husband. you have a great product and a good start, everything is going to be ok, now refine and sharpen your skills.
 
you’re going further mentality in not a answer. i think you have other options not explored or if explored not in detail. let’s start with your need for funds. it’s clear you have exhausted all creditable means of raising funds and then some. but allow me to ask some questions. have you explored liquidating your investment real estate, is there any profits there if sold, this works? if no, have you looked at selling it for a higher price and owner financing it? most laws will not let you “owner finance” if you have a mortgage balance but almost all will allow you to do a do a lease purchase or contract for deed. what this can do is create additional funds and income, right now. you can ask a much higher price for the home and require a good cash down payment in addition to the interest rate which will be high because you’re being the bank help someone that can not get a loan other wise.  you will still own the home on paper and all these additional funds can be used to support your sweet dream beds. and the best part is, the funds do not have to be paid back. another option i see is downsizing, home, autos ect. reduce any dept not supportive of your business. 
 
from your web site i see you’re in a commercial building have you explored moving into a much small building until production warrant a larger space? can you move it into your garage at home and maybe place a portable storage building for holding your supplies, using your garage space for production only? i know all this is not ideal, but you have stated you’re willing to make hard choices.  
 
another issue is your marketing, you have a great product and a great web site but you can’t do a common search of (custom made children beds) and find you, i didn’t,  and i went through 5 pages, and the industry says if you cant be found in the first 3 pages your wasting your time. a good web site with good honest and credible information that may help you in this area is www.coffeecup.com they explain the most productive ways to list your site. i have nothing to do with them other than being a fan of good honest, legitimate information. your web site is hidden you need to fix that. 
 
another area you should look at is your 6-8 weeks production time, is there any room for improving that without sacrificing quality?  can jigs and templates be made for common sized parts? can templates be made for your art work? you see where i’m going with that. anything that will reduce your production time will save you money, thus increasing your funds and making your business stronger. 
 
my next suggestion is to simplify your ordering process, its great you suggest a phone conservation, but i feel you are asking much to involvement of your customers, i don’t have any real answer for you in this arena not knowing your process, but i would advise you to take note of  the number one rule in business  “make it easy for your customers to do business with you” maybe your webmaster can come up with a interactive way to simplify the task of blueprinting a room. 
 
another suggestion, have you looked at adding more products that complement with your main product? maybe, custom made under the bed, toy storage? simple toy boxes with colorful themes, window treatment, wall boarder templates that match the beds? even toys. a great source of buying toys and children items or any item for that matter can be found at www.worldwidebrands.com. you could start selling smaller related items and have them dropped shipped without any capital outlay creating a new support income. again, i have nothing to do with this company other than my appreciation of good honest, legitimate information.  
i can go on and on joann but i think you and your husband have a world of options not explored because of your mind set of borrowing funds to survive. you do not have your backs to the wall.  take a step back, relax, go to dinner (just keep it cheap) you guys are going to make it to the top in a big way, just don’t give up, take little steps, and one of them will catapult you, i promise. good luck.   leon steward ceo the steward group inc..
ok so here`s the deal i need some cash to get a web site going. i`m looking for minimum $50. yea i know just charge it, or ask parents for it etc. but you see the problem is a bit deeper.1. my wife has cut me off the credit cards (actually we cut each other off since she`s gone back to school)2. parents aren`t into hand-outs becuase they are already invested in a longer term business opp with me.3. like i said money`s tight since my wife has gone back to school so even a small $50 withdrawal can have rippling effects.the business idea is dirt simple and doesn`t require any real capital after the first investments because of my already established connections.the bizopp is basic. a web site where i (or others) post product reviews and then the community can post follow-up reviews / comments. ratings are super simple yea or nea none of this "on a scale from 1 - 10" stuff. i`ve found people see these and go, ok i see the 9 but i really like the 8 will i hate myself for buying the 8 versus the 9? so any ideas?btw if anyone wants to pony up i`ll gladly offer advertising on my site for a period of time. drop me a line!.
how will your site generate revenue? 
how do you plan on beating out the already established websites that
offer reviews?  (i use amazon all the time for the purpose of
looking up what other people think of products.  rather that just
looking at the number rating i read the comments, some people rate
something low, but you can tell when you read their complaints that
they were too busy drooling to use the product they are rating.) 
it`s not just the rating it`s knowing who is rating it.
do you have experience programming and operating a website?
i wouldn`t mind helping you get set up with a site, but i am still
unclear where the money is going to come from.  hard to get
advertisers from anyone whose products you have reviewed on your site
and appear impartial, and i can`t see this being a pay site.  what
are you thinking?
robert.
a few ideas i`ll implement (open to any others of course!)revenue will be generated from ad`s produced from google adsense and adbrite. later on i might try to figure out a way to do this "in-house" but for now i`ll farm it out.the site will also use affiliate links when linking to places to purchase the product in hopes people will use these links to jump to the product they just read reviews oni plan to distribute reviews via the web site, rss feeds and at some point i`d like to produce a weekly podcast to discuss the stuff we`ve reviewed. all three of these mediums can support advertising on some level.again as the community grows i`m sure other opportunities will be revealednow to address your concerns on "beating out the already established web sites that offer reviews", the answer is simple. i`m not planning on beating them out. if anything i hope to compliment them and assist users in affirming their decision to buy or not to buy.  secondly with the available api`s out there it shouldn`t be too hard to have say the current amazon rating posted along side my sites review (with a link back via affiliate of course!).do you have experience programming and operating a web site?i`ve been building web sites long before it was cool or even profitable. i`ve ran 3 blogs in my live time, built full fledged communities from the ground up, written articles on programming and i`ve written reviews of software and services in the past. i`ve done the previously stated work with sitepoint.com and lockergnome.com as well as personal blogs and sites i`ve run.i`m currently a full time coldfusion developer (ie programming) which i`ve been doing for 3 almost 4 years (certified by adobe / macromedia recently). before that i was a php and asp programming and enjoyed working in those languages for many years. i`ve got some design skill but admit i`m no designer. i can write the code to make those pretty sites work. i have lots of experience with databases and working with web service api`s. i`ve currently work in a web development firm in atlanta ga but before that i managed the entire web world for the military intelligence group in az. (which consisted of over 30 web sites, a portal, and many databases and services).so yes i have experience programming and operating web sites. none 100% in this area but my combined experience fills the bucket pretty good. what i can`t do i`ll learn to do it, or i`ll find someone who can. i`m not afraid to step back and let someone else drive a bit.hope this helps you out a bit, and thanks for making me think!i have to admit i never tried to turn it into a business but i love reviewing stuff and sharing my opinion with others. i`ve developed many contacts over the years with software companies, book publishers, service providers etc so i`m sure i`ll be able to build up the content..
how are you different from epinions.com.
our reviews will be started by either a staffer or by a community memeber who`s had there review vetter, edited etc before posting. this way we garuntee at least one well written and thourgh review. we`ll also push all the marketing and purchasing spin off to a less obtrusive place.the think i hate about epinons is that you have to do so much clicking to get to your review. my plans is to make it easy to get to the review and then the purchase of the product will follow.we`ll also not use the 5 start rating system like epinons, instead it will be a simple yea or nea ratings. on the negative side for my site it won`t have the deeper reviews initially that you see for some product like cameras where they rate the battery life etc as well.excellent question thanks!.
you mentioned that the reviews will be started by "a staffer or by a community member". do you plan to have a full-time staff running the site/business? also, where will the community members come from? in other words, how will you advertise the site in order to get people to sign up as "community members"? 
just a thought - it might be helpful to limit the reviews to certain types of products in the beginning, until you get the site up and running. that way you can focus your advertising efforts more efficiently. since you mentioned amazon, i will use books as an example. if you limit the reviews to books, you will be able to narrow your advertising efforts to avid readers. the site will also look more relevant (and appealing) if it has 100 book reviews, rather than 10 book reviews and 5 car reviews and 20 software reviews. after you have established a following you can gradually add other categories and build on your previous success..
karenscharfinitially the "staff" will be myself and anyone else who will work for free :) so i will be the primary on just about everything with friends and other interested parties lending a hand here and there.initially community members will be spread via word of mouth, and grass roots efforts. i have a few blogger contacts that i can feed the story to who will (hopefully) in turn publish something about it.i love the idea of focusing tight initially. i`ve thought about this and i`ll probably stick with the big guns. books, movies, music software and games. the movies and music sections probably won`t be there at launch since i`m not sure how much content i can pull from my resources.the other thing i`d like to do is collect reviews but not publish them until i reach a certain number of reviewed items. ie 10 mystery books will launch a mystery book section. not sure how to spin this though to make it act like an incentive for people to submit there own reviews.great points! thanks!!.
for micro-loans, you might check-out www.prosper.com.  it`s basically a peer-based lending model.  i haven`t tried it yet, but i know the model has been very successful in the uk..
i agree greatly with "karenscharf." in my opinion, and 
experience, you should `narrow reviews to certain types of 
products in the beginning.` my retail website was originally an 
"anything goes" type of retail site. through the past year, i have 
learned narrowing my efforts is more effective until the 
followers develop. i have gone from an "anything goes" online 
retail store to an "earthborn & handmade" retail store. i still 
have a few items, which don`t really fit the earthborn & 
handmade idea, but i have found by concentrating on a rising 
star area of the site i have had better response and placement 
from search engines. it`s also really helped when conversing 
with other business owners or potential visitors as to what my 
online retail store sells and offers. of course, non-sarcastically, 
good luck.
oh, just a quick side note… i’m am definitely not the greatest 
speller, or writer, but i suggest passing your posts through a 
spell checker (ms word?) and proof read it before posting. 
people really look at your written communications to assess 
your competence and preparedness. i don’t mean this as a jab 
to your side, i just mean people, investors, potential visitors, get 
turned off by simple mistakes like that. i wouldn’t want you to 
miss an opportunity simply because you didn’t “check yourself, 
before you wreck yourself.” in other words do all you can to 
present yourself as confident, capable, and ready for business. 
:).
thanks kprince i`ll check it out..
hi everyone!  as the newly elected point man of the sun project #1 i would like all participating members to consider the following:
moving ahead in a such a manner that everyone knows where we are in the process is extremely important.  participation levels are imporant too, so i`d like to ask everyone participating to log in to this site and locate sun project #1 topics at least once every weekday for a while in order to keep any process moving along in a timely manner.  i`d like to refrain from any decision making on the weekends, if everyone is in agreement.
the first poll has been created and is called "heads up! poll #1 by point man".  the poll will close wednesday, november 8th at 5pm cst.  i encourage everyone to participate..
mitey mite ~ sun project #1 point man.
i started up an outsourcing company in march that is nearing the completion of all the initial planning.  i am ready to take the concept to the market.  the problem is that i have a day job that is preventing me from spending the kind of time i need on my new business.  also, the type of business i am starting would definately be a conflict of interest with my current employer.  when do i make the leap?  i do not have any clients yet even though i have confidence in the business plan.  how do you know when the time has come?.
jason,
i guess the question is how long can you go without a paycheck?  a rule of thumb i`ve heard is you should be able to go a year without *cashing* a paycheck from your job.
problem is, if you end up hurting for $$$$ you`ll put too much pressure on the business.  i`d recommend pulling the all-nighters until things get off the ground.  it almost always takes a lot longer to get going than we`d all like..
i have a year`s worth of living expenses saved up except for the health insurance i will be leaving behind.  does anyone have any suggestions for a low cost, high quality health insurance provider for small businesses?.
jason,
i`ve made the "leap" from a real job to self-unemployment before.  it is a gut-check for sure.  i had some rough patches, but never looked back.   
for me, the trigger to jump was a situation at work where i was about to be committed to a two year project and i didn`t want to leave my employer high and dry when i did walk, so i bowed out on the front end, pissed everyone off when i did and by the reactions i got, knew then that i made the right decision.  and i didn`t have 1 year in the bank.  
actually did it a second time when i got out of the technology consulting business to build my high-tech, alternative materials/energy homes.  i tried to spin up the construction company while i ran the consulting operations, but i found that i couldn`t do get the new business off the ground with part-time effort.
if you find that you cannot effectively operate your new business on a part-time basis, then do the gut-check and go/no-go.
as far as your request for " low cost, high quality health insurance provider for small businesses", these are all subjective terms.  in my experience, the answer is none, however a good provider is blue-cross/blue-shield.  you will pay a price for their coverage, but it is one of the best in the business..
jason,
blue-cross/blue-shield is the best coverage from a quality standpoint.  but it is expensive and may not be something you can get for a small group or just for yourself.  there are other products in the market that are designed for individuals or small groups.  for example, golden rule is an insurance carrier that has ok coverage - not a bcbs by any means but decent plans for the money.  they feature high deductible plans that are very low cost.  a high deductible plan means you are paying maybe the first $500 to $2,000 of medical costs and then they pick it up after you meet the deductible each year.  you can team that policy up with a health savings account and get some added tax benefits.  golden rule and other carriers like them that write individual medical insurance typically require you to answer medical and health history questions.  if you have had or expect to have health issues these policies may not work for you.
i hope this helps if you want some more details you are welcome to contact my office in michigan at 866 774-4872 or email me chris@mainstreetptrs.com.
thanks.
hi jason,
i believe your situation to be similar to anyone looking to switch jobs
or careers, you probably need to have your back-up plan in order,
unless going to your day job is truly making you unhappy, then you`ve
got to go with your gut make a move.
in my own situation, i had emotional and financial support at home, so
i was able to say goodbye to corporate life to concentrate on my
business.
but one thing is for certain, you`ve got to put the hours in to the
start-up to even give it half a chance.  i remember while i was
still at my day job, trying to do both and both things suffered, not to
mention my psyche....
jason,
i made the leap from corporate america to my own business. the way it worked for me was that i started out by working all night on the website development projects after i worked from 8am-5pm at the corp. job. my managers and co-workers knew what i did after 5pm and eventually it began to cost me money by working the 8am-5pm day job. i gave my notice and took the cobra route for 18 months for me and my family because i am a diabetic. after that i went through a payroll company and got set up with company benefits through my company. i paid $1100 through cobra fopr my wife and our baby and myself. now i only pay about $700 through blue cross blue shield. so the short answer would be, that i would moonlight for the time being and even spend my lunch hour dedicated to your personal business. it will ultimately come down to whether or not you are a risk-taker. a risk taker will give notice tomorrow and realize that it is sink or swim time. if you are dedicated to your business and get up each day and make the calls the business will come in..
"also, the type of business i am starting would definately be a conflict of interest with my current employer"
i can apprecite your desire for entreprenuership and all the advice that has been given.  my only issue is that nobody has addressed the "conflict of interest" issue.
maybe i`m to big on ethical behavior, but in my humble opinion the very first question that should be answered is the conflict of interest issue.  
it may be the case  because i feel that "what goes around, comes around"  and if you think it is acceptable to take a paycheck from your employer all the time you are developing a business that will compete with your current employer, you may also feel you can do other things  that may be perceived  as unethical like establishing you client base up or even illegal before you make the brake.
i do not believe that is the case yet because you had added it to your post and it was important enough to ask for advice.  its a tough call.
i`ll just give you two questions.
how would you feel if someone did that to you?
regarding the conflict of interest issue "stay for as long as you can and still be able to sleep at night"i hope i wasn`t to hard.  i`m  just trying to give you something to think about  and possibly a different perspective.
good luck and i wish you the best,
btw you didn`t mention anything about the business specifics, so i`ll assume that you are indeed very confident about your business plan, but if there is anything i can contribute to help you out  i am looking forward to it.  my way of establishing myself in the area in which i am best at.
 
mike.
the book "built to last" highlights that a key aspect of long-term successful businesses is they start on a set of principles, and uphold them.  i believe that many software companies begin with the final product in mind, and don`t believe this is the best way.
i`m researching the best of breed features of various business applications, ranging from erp to single-vertical systems.  functionality is fairly commoditized (i.e., wms or ap applications do basically the same things).  i believe that there are gaping holes in three key areas:
==&gt; improving the user experience (i.e., kiss, decreased learning curve)
==&gt; creating a rapid implementation framework (i.e, 3 months or less as a rule)
==&gt; creating a rapid development framework withing a consistent look and feel, web-native, service-oriented architecture
i believe that building the right framework, keeping a set of standards at heart, from scratch is key to creating the next big thing in business applications.  i believe that this will enable a new application suite to enter the market at significant advantage in pricing, implementation time, and maintenance costs.
ultimately, i`d like to find a core team of software and/or business professionals with an entrepeneurial spirit, keen imagination, and aggressive personality to make this a reality.  in the mean time, i`ve been pulling out key features of my own companies applications, and researching those of others.  
this is just an idea now.  it`ll take a lot of effort and determination to make it a reality.  i believe in it though.
any thoughts, comments, or interest in this idea would be appreciated.
thanks..
i highly recommned you read the follow-up book to "built to last," which is titled, "good to great."  the author believes this new book describes what occurs in businessnes that start out, climbing to greatness or sinking to mediocrity.
i`d like to hear from others on their thoughts on these two books.
thanks.
hey everyone--
i did not read built to last, but i did read good to great. it`s kind of a company bible where i work.i think collins is right on target. with one word of caution: i notice people become almost paralyzed with "greatness," so much so that they are afraid to take any steps... is this really our hedge hog concept? is this person on the right seat of the bus?if taken to far, i believe it could be stifling for an innovation culture. sometimes you need to say, "what the hell... let`s try it out and see what happens."i find myself saying (often): it`s good to great, people, not good to perfect.
just my two cents.
matt.
does anyone have any thoughts on the different business planning software packages availible?  
i have looked at the recommendation by sn (abs) but am leaning towards palo alto business plan pro prem. 2006.  does anyone have any positive/negative reviews for this software..
scott,
this question has a lot of merit. palo alto is a good product, widely used, graded highly by those who rank software. the abs product at our site is also good and gets high marks.
i`m really curious to see what people`s experiences and preferences are. it might impact what we offer going forward.
wishing you success with your startup-
rich.
we use pro and have for about 7 years.  about 90% of
our clients do.  so its kind of like quickbooks, i wouldn`t say its the
best software but everyone uses it and therefore if you want to collaborate on
a project it helps when everyone has the same software..
as a new member of this site, i would like to make my first post as follows:
thank goodness! and thankyou! jeff and rick sloan.  and a big "thank you" to your parents as well, for raising two extremely "high-quality human beings" (on all levels). it only took me a few minutes (perhaps seconds) to realize this fact. i would like to say more - but, i choose not to for this simple fact.  "i`ll always be one-word-short".  my favorite saying is: "hold to truth as though your heart had teeth". so too, should we hold on to those who "maintain" a keen sense of our "original state"...goodness!.
you have now seen what every other member in here has seen. but the guys will tell you its a team effort. joel, heather, and the rest of the staff totally rock also. the more you surf the site, the more you will see how everyone plays a part that keeps this well oiled machine running. 
not meaning to steal the thunder from rich and jeff, just giving props to all here that have made my life alot easier..
welcome mary lyn! i can`t wait to see you on the big idea - we will all celebrate with you........
ah..it felt nice to read your post. you are home indeed and i have a funny feeling that you are going to contribute a lot in here. well, the world needs you my friend..
hello mary lyn and welcome to sun! and you have come to the right place. hope you get lots out of your time here and contribute to others knowledge as well..
welcome!.
i just launched a poll on one of the boards. i notice that you guys don`t allow for us to count the number of votes but only percentage. this is horrible because we count the actual votes tallied. percentage doesn`t mean anything because it could have been just a few people voted and i wouldn`t know..
great suggestion dean.
keep them coming!.
update: please visit this post for the updated guidelines.
alright i am ready to play!.
joel,
thank alot for getting this up here..
joel,
jessica mentioned that she thought i may be able to provide some help to your users and eventually become a trusted resource. i would like nothing more than that, so any advice that you have about how to go about replying to questions that i can help with and not sound like a sales pitch would be appreciated. i`ve tried to be clear about my intentions in my profile and posts. if it`s overkill, i`d like to know that too. 
thanks for the help,
nick.
thanks kathy! not a big team, but a great one. and yes, lots of work that we love doing. we`re glad you`re here and encourage you to bring along a friend!!.
hello,the business that i am going to be asking about is for my fiance. he has begun to start a business with a group of men but,it did ont work out with them so he is on his own now.he has put so much time and money into this that he can not pull out.so my question to anyone is.where can he get help in funding for this business.need help.
niecy:
while i certainly feel for the pain of your fiance`s situation, there isn`t enough information in your post for me to offer any viable solution. the phrase "put so much time and money into it - he can`t pull out" should be supported by a current feasibility analysis.
the next question would be - how much funding is needed?

hello all.i joined startup nation a bit ago but haven`t done much with the membership yet. have to do something about that.my business is doing information research (think freelance librarian who hasn`t the time constraints of a public librarian at an institution). i`ve done research for books, public records and financial filings searches, patent and trademark searches, computer security news monitoring and executive updates, along with many other types of research over the years and am now trying to do such work as an independent. potential clients always seem so surprised that independent researchers exist. so the  biggest problem in setting up this business is turning out to be: how do you draw attention when no one is looking? there has to be a way. someday i`ll find it good to meet you all..
hi linda, and welcome to the board.that sounds like an exciting and ever-changing career. i can`t imagine that you ever get bored doing something like that. how did you get into it?.
what art units do you search at pto?.
hello christina. i got into this via having a masters of library and information science degree and wanting to be able to work remotely so as to go back to living rurally, preferably in a forest. libraries aren`t very telecommuting friendly yet. and true, boredom is not a problem. one recent job involved finding out in there were bodies buried under a lawn as a result of a disease outbreak in the late 1800`s. (there weren`t. the outbreak didn`t happen.) i love the questions that come out of left field, they`re so much fun to work on.hello james. thus far i`ve worked primarily in 709, 359 andd 372, doing searches for engineers and scientists. but i`m adaptable. the entire point to doing this work is to continue learning all the time..
hey there and welcome!
sounds like fun.  i always wanted to be the fact person for the food network.  can you imagine researching who came up with the name jello...lol..
just a question for you all but do i have to post a recent photo its been a 
tough couple of months trying to get this thing off the ground! lol
 
just testing out the forum etc....
i saw a cary grant postage stamp photo that might work well..
here you go....
hi food folks. i joined the startup nation community recently, updated my profile yesterday and am ready to engage.

erin’s idea here is terrific, and because it’s the first day of the labor day weekend, i’d like to contribute three recipes: a family favorite, one adapted from another source, and one that’s all our own (my soft companion, vicki, and me).

great-aunt laura, like most of the women on mom’s side, was an indiana farm girl, and i’m here to testify that farm girls can cook. (one of their big advantages, of course, was the easy availability of the freshest seasonal ingredients right outside their doors.) at gatherings, one of her many favorites (including farm-fresh deviled eggs with just a trace of amaretto stirred into the yolk filling as a sweetener) is marinated four-bean salad. we’ve been eating it for (mumble) years, and it’s still the best i’ve ever shoveled into my yap. at the risk of a certain kind of sacrilege, i sometimes add a fifth bean, garbanzos (chickpeas, chichi beans, ceci beans), just because i like ’em.

make this today if you can, because as good as it is on the same day, it’s transformed when allowed to marinate for two.

aunt laura’s marinated bean salad
for the salad:
1 can (14-16 oz.) each: green beans, wax beans, small red (kidney) beans, butter beans and garbanzos (optional), drained and rinsed in cold water. 
1 cup each chopped celery and onion (sweet onions like vidalia, walla walla, maui or oso sweets are best) 
½ cup chopped green pepper 
1/4 cup (small jar) chopped pimientos (most of us call them “pimentos,” which really refers to spanish allspice. food trivia: pimientos, when dried instead of canned, are ground into paprika).for the dressing/marinade:
1-1/2 cup each, sugar and white (or cider) vinegar 
½ cup cooking oil (corn, canola, peanut, but not olive)
combine the dressing ingredients. bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, then remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
combine the salad ingredients, add on the dressing, stir well and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.

spicy-as-you-want smoky honey sauce
make this today or tomorrow to get a little age on it and allow the flavors to combine. i adapted this from a recipe on www.honey.com. i’m a beekeeper, so honey shows up in a lot of the stuff i cook. it includes chipotle pepper (chee-pote-lay, not chuh-pole-tea, like emeril and others so persistently mispronounce it), which is smoked jalapeno, sometimes available dried, but more commonly canned and packed in tomato-based adobo sauce. you can find them in the ethnic foods section of most any decent supermarket these days. add a tad of the adobo to this recipe for more tang.
this is fantastic for burgers, but once you taste it, you’ll think of all kinds of other things to use it on.)
combine:
1 canned chipotle pepper, sliced or chopped 
1/3 cup honey 
2 tablespoons miracle whip (or mayo, but the mw adds a different sweetness) 
2 tablespoons ketchup 
1 tablespoon yellow mustardblend thoroughly and refrigerate until ready to use.

on labor day, if you plan to make some tasty burgers, try these. please don’t waste your money on ground beef labeled “hamburger” (too much fat by weight) or steak cuts like sirloin (too little fat, too little flavor, cooks up dry). use ground chuck. it has the perfect meat-to-fat ratio for burgers, cooks up juicy and full of flavor, and is by far the first choice of professional chefs.
vicki and i like to use mexican cheese for our burgers, either queso blanco, which becomes soft and creamy, but doesn’t melt when heated; or chihuahua, a very light yellow, semi-soft cheese sometimes called queso menonita, because it was first made by mennonites in northern mexico. both are getting easier to find in good supermarkets, and are always in the cooler in mexican food stores. if you can’t find them, substitute monterey jack.
this is the way we like to do it:

southwestern “cheeseburgers”
enough ground chuck to make a half-pound patty per person (or no less than a quarter-pound), well-chilled. 
sliced queso blanco, chihuahua or monterey jack 
salt, any mexican (or american) chili powder, dried oregano (preferably mexican, which has a more pungent flavor)season the ground chuck liberally and shape into an even number of thin patties. don’t squeeze or handle the meat any more than necessary to shape it; the warmth in your hands will start to melt the fat and ruin the texture of the burgers. place a slice or two of cheese on half the patties, then top with the other half. press lightly around the edges to seal the cheese inside.
grill or pan-fry the burgers just until a little cheese starts to ooze out of each, serve on good kaiser or onion rolls, top with spicy-as-you-want smoky honey sauce or your favorite condiments, a thick slice of red or sweet onion, maybe a slice of fully ripe tomato, and chow.

one more thing: give some thought and thanks to the hard-working folks who built this country and still are its backbone, then lustily feed your face and have a great time.

sorry about the long post. it’s my first time..
this requires a shift in priorities!
clearly, i will have to change the "one thing i will accomplish today" i already logged. 
thanks for the ideas!.
despair.com is a great site (i love their posters).  i just noticed they now have "demotivational" video clips on their site.  i laughed so hard at their "handling employee complaints" video. 
link
enjoy!
~kim.
okay, that`s scary because i think in some companies it`s sort of true! yikes! that`s a great reminder of why many of us have chosen to be our own bosses!.
classic,  "addressing employee complaints" is hilarious (watch til the very end), thanks for the link!.
very funny..
this is great.  i forwarded the link to a friend.  the posters are very funny!.
seems like the beta community is starting to exchange ideas,  communicate etc. which is great! i think it would be great to get the startupnation guinea pigs together for some kind of meet and greet either on the site or via a conference call to say hello. i think there are 29 people plus the startupnation staff. we can all have a drink and introduce ourselves ( finally an excuse to sit home alone with a drink lol). what does everyone think? i will even buy the first round if we can figure out how to get cocktails sent via paypal still cold, now there is an idea!  
matt.
sounds good to me!
matt s..
matt, you`re referring to the 31 member startupnation community advisory board who got a sneak peek to this new beta community aspect of the site. although still in beta, this is already live to the entire startupnation community and some of the contributors on these forum topics are not (yet) community advisory board members. we just have not done any promotion yet to community in these early post-launch days as we make some basic updates.
the community board will get together for a conference call soon and matt you may feel free to crack open a cold one for that meeting!
thanks to everyone who has contributed so far. this resource will only improve with age!.
count me in.
which entrepreneur/business magazines, newspapers, books have you found helpful enough to recommend to other sunnies -ers -ites?  just looking on amazon, there are thousands of books, dozens of magazines and newspapers - which ones do you like?  maybe even, gasp, another website?
ps - what are we called?  is there a consensus on what members of the forum are collectively called?.
business 2.0 is indispendible... indespensable... indispens....i can`t do without it.anyhow. i`m not sure what we`re called... i like sunies. i toyed with suns-a-rich`s... but i thought he might be offended..
theswaynesterthat`s as funny as a suns-a-rich! i think your right about offensive though..
sunnies verges on sunnis vs. shiites. and we`re not going there!
and sun`s-a-richs would only be offensive to jeff. (remember, big brothers always need more acknowledgement than we youngens...)
sunsters?
sunsons/sundaughters?
suniacs?
sunday/sunnight?
sunrisers?
sunson? (good for japanese community members)
bisun? (no, that could be terribly misinterpreted)
sunsters...
as for magazines/books, etc., you may want to check out the thread on that topic here... or here.....
i`m also a big fan of make magazine... if inventing is your thing.sunchkins?.
i`ve never seen make magazine. what does it contain / cover?.
suntrepreneurs?.
make covers a range of projects and hobbies--from building swings to robotics...i just like it because (since i`m not very technical) the articles are fairly simple to follow--so this it`s educational.check it out here: http://www.makezine.com/
sunderdogs?.
i`m kicking around some ideas to automate parts of our bakery operation. 
what types of inventions do you work with? what process do you go
through to determine whether an idea is feasible and worth pursuing?.
i have a few product ideas that i`ve been messing around with. the electronics part is my weak spot. but i`m learning.as far as the process... i mentally play with the idea to see if it`s feasible. i have my wife to bounce the idea off of. a few friends. some online research. and, then, i do some work on the uspto.gov site, looking for prior art and patents that may cover the idea.my next step is to create a prototype. testing the waters there.that`s pretty much it.sun-n-funders?.
congratulations to jeff in the startupnation community.
his innovative business, offices2share.com, hit the front page of yahoo! in the news with its "home office from hell" contest.
that was definitely an outrageous idea...and quite a winning one!
keep up the spirit jeff!!!!.
nice going, jeff!.
i`m pleased to tell somebody that i actually did something last night and attempted making this thing i`m talking about in that other thread about ideas and skillsets.  basically, since i have to tell you what it is for the story to make sense :), it`s a new kind of crayon.  i told you it was for the younger kids to play with!  the trick is that it`s unbreakable so you dont have little stubby pieces all over the place, and it can actually color in lots of different colors.  and no, in case anybody`s thinking it, it is not a "rainbow crayon" where you basically just mix all the colors together.  you can make those yourself at home.  think more along the lines of one of those pens where you can get red/blue/green/black ink depending on which button you push.anyway, 10:30 last night, wife and kids are asleep and i`m sitting around watching tivo reruns and reading blogs on the laptop, when yesterday`s conversation finally gets me motivated to put it down and go actually try something.  so i work on melting some crayon bits in the microwave like i have learned to do from researching the homemade crayon market (lots of info out there, by the way, but no mention of what i want to attempt).i`m happy to report that i learned something:  the melting point of the plastic drinking cup i used for a mold is just slightly higher than the melting point of the crayons.  so when the solid crayon stopped melting and the liquid crayon started heating up, i had crayon soup all over my microwave.luckily i got it all cleaned up before my wife woke up!.
ah... i love the smell of melting crayon in the morning.it smells like.... genius.
congrats on the first step.(i heard edison`s wife was very particular about his workspace, as well. he had to pick up shards of broken light bulbs constantly.).
ha! i love it. you`re already building "those stories" you`ll tell when being interviewed about your idea :).
lol. bardstuff, that`s great! good for you in taking the first step. now for the next?
funny, `nester, i was thinking of thomas edison too. i bet if he had a place like this to get feedback, things would have gone more quickly for him..
i would love to hear your thoughts on what you consider to be the top business books (in any category)!  i haven`t read that many books but here is the start of my list: 1. startupnation 2. blink 3. resonant leadershipthanks!.
i did enjoy the sun  by the sloan bros. my other choice is by napoleon hill "think and grow rich.".
for people who have an invention and are thinking about patenting - "patent it yourself" by david pressman is great. that book helped me a lot back in my inventing days, and dave and i actually became friends and still email 10 years later!.
for the business end of sales, i like "jeffrey gitomers little red book of selling."  makes you think about the process in different ways, but be forwarned it`s rather unforgiving.for an interesting story & analysis, almost what not to do early on, try "the apple way.".
for a sales book, the 7 most powerful selling secrets
by john livesay, has a foreword by tim sanders. interesting take on sales. 
-dave.
great ideas guys & gals!  keep them coming..
i am a fan of the idiots guides.  they are simple to understand.  i also loved martha stewart`s book - martha`s rules.  i had to take the dust jacket off, though, so i didn`t have to be reminded it was martha - lol!
i also like getting things done by david allen.  i am the type of person who holds the to do list in my head and stresses about everything that needs to be done for the next 6 months.  i am learning to purge my brain onto paper and take one thing at a time and ignore what`s coming up too far in the future.  the book has helped me do that.  
~kim.
currently, i am focused on books that can be categorized as `wisdom of the ages.`  this ebook is free as my thank you for doing business with me.  
visit me at: www.crystalclearvision.myarbonne.com, and click on the tab with the title: "immaculately r.i.c.h."
life-changing wisdom never goes out of style! this classic work has truly stood the test of time, selling tens of millions of copies and remaining in constant demand.
the science of getting rich, by wallace d. wattles.
this book is a classic and was published in 1910; it`s a precursor to napoleon hill`s classic think and grow rich.
 
"there is a science of getting rich, and it is an exact science like algebra or arithmetic.  there are certain laws which govern the process of acquiring riches; once these laws are learned and obeyed by any man he will get rich with mathematical certainly."
 
named one of the all-time best business books by brian tracy!.
yep, goto google and type-in milliondollar bookshelf - the best self-help books for free download - no strings!! including `think and grow rich`
also, try buying books on ebay - there are a lot
of how-to`s without big names (afterall, those big names really don`t write their own books - theyuse ghost writers) for far less!! i buy books for
under a dollar plus modest shipping costs, then
skim books for specific content and combine
info. into a scrap book - it would foolish to think
one author has all the answers. i have friend who
believes `rich dad, poor dad` books have proprietary
information that is hardly found elsewhere!! why go to school? lol.
entrepreneur magazine`s start your own business was great. i still dig it out on occasion. i also learned more than i first thought i would from daniel kennedy`s the ultimate sales letter. i`m still in search of any and all great business books, so thanks for the thread.
kimberly j..
iouone2,i typically do but today is a hectic day here in the office so if i slip up a bit with my posts i apologize, i`m usually a pretty prolific writer.you note is noted though and i feel it`s something everyone should pay attention to at all times, not just in public areas like this!.
isn`t this what amazon.com does?.
kim,actually it`s more like epinons.com but yes it`s very similar to what amazon does. as i pointed out above though, i`m hoping to do somethings differantly and offer more as the site grows. which the snc is helping with all these posts and questions!.
i also just found www.fundable.org, which looks a bit like www.prosper.com.  interesting sites for funding....
awesome thanks kprince! i haven`t fully looked at prosper.com but it does look interesting..
ok so i went and checked out the two sites. prosper.com seems more like something someone would do for a large amount of money while the fundable.org looks like it works well for any amount. i`m still keeping my options open but i think the fundable.org one will be a good bet!.
does anyone subscribe to this and recommend it?  i am in the process of picking out some magazines and i`m trying to decide between that and smartmoney, the economist, businessweek and conde nast portfolio.  i don`t want a magazine that`s focused on the tech market because that`s not the type of business i want to start.  i`m planning to do retail (i.e., clothing, accessories, giftware) and would like a publication that can help me with the nuts and bolts.also, if you have some good books to recommend, please pass along the titles!  thank you!.
i get entrepreneur magazine.  i read it front to back every time it shows up.  they cover all types of differnet businesses.  from taking inventions to market to buying franchises.  very interesting and informative..
the e-myth revisited by michael gerber - can not recommend it enough..
i recommend business2.0 a time, inc. subsidiary.  business 2.0 is published monthly, except bi-monthly jan and feb. ~an excellent mag for any business.
to compliment joy`s recommendation: e-myth mastery, also by michael gerber..
even though it has more of a political viewpoint than an entrepreneurial focus, i`m a fan of the economist..........here`s a link to give gift subscriptions for $69.99.  pretty good deal for this particular rag.  
 
edit - i can`t get the link to become active in the forum for some reason....if you`re interested, just send me a msg and i`ll get the info to you.
 
tracy.
diddo on e-myth revisted by  michael gerber!
i also recommend the purple cow by seth godin..
hi joe,doesn`t look like anyone`s given a plug to inc magazine, but i`d highly recommend it. always a great read.in terms of books, check out `leading at the speed of growth - journey from entrepreneur to ceo` by the kauffman foundation.enjoy,andrew.
i`m on the last chapter of citizen marketing. it is a great book for anyone who owns a business. anyone else read it?.
sorry guys...i suppose you could read the book...but it is really meant for the females. i have to say...i have read jsut about every inspirational, self-motivating, self-help, business geared, turn-your-life-around book i can get my hands on...and i just started reading one that actually has me so excited that for the first time (in a long time) i feel compelled to tell the entire world about this book! i think every woman should read it!!! whether you know what you want...or are completely lost...this is a definate must in your library!!!
"inside every woman" by vickie millazo 
she also has a website http://www.insideeverywoman.com 
i am telling you what ladies...if you think you had the motivation before...or if you have been finding yourself lost in a see of the same old same old....you have got to read this book!!!
not only does it give great advice...it actually gives you exercises to do to help you use the advice! not only that...but it is really a super easy read! usually i fall asleep to these books...i have about 6 on my nightstand for nights i have trouble getting to sleep...lastnight i was up until wee hours trying to get in one more sentence!!!
anyway...i am starting to sound like and infomercial now...so i will stop...but seriously...you have got to check it out!!!.
thanks for the recommendation, leah! i`m in need of something like this right now!  i`m going to hastings this evening.........i`ll see if i can get my hands on a copy.
 
fwiw, another great read for women is jean chatzky`s, make money, not excuses.  it is specifically written for woman and offers an excellent viewpoint on women and finances..
oww...thanks for the other recommendation...i will have to check that one out too!! (i should really invest in stock with amazon or something.)  i am always looking for good financial reads that focus on women...i don`t think as many people realize how different it is for a woman when dealing with finances. i just got done reading, not too long ago, "smart women finish rich" by david bach. another good read...and he totally points out the pitfalls that women have when attempting to gain financial security and freedom. i think the thing i liked about his book was that it worked with the idea in some cases that we have nothing to really work with when first trying to save money and invest.  i went to a seminar that was based on the book as well...not as great as the book...one of those things where you had to have money to buy the product to get the real advice...but informative none-the-less. good read though. 
thanks again for the suggestion...i will pick it up with my next amazon purchase!.
i`ll have to pick that one up, as well, leah.  i`ve got david bach`s automatic millionaire, which is also a great read.  i`ve never picked up the smart women...book because i assumed it was similar info - but you are right about the importance of focusing on the financial issues of women.  thanks for the recommedation.
my `to read` list is getting longer and longer these days!  lol it`s just about caught up with my `to do` list!.
lol...my "to read" list is out of control...the worst part...i have a bad habit of buying the book instead of just putting it on the list...so i have more of a "to read" library!i have really got to stop that! 
if anyone else has any great books specially written for the feminine community...please recommend (gives my husband something to complain about when i buy a new book )!.
great reco leah!  
i have heard good things about this book. will pick up a copy! 
another insightful book is pitch like a girl by ronna lichtenberg
she too has a website: http://www.askronna.com/
this book is very helpful for understanding how to assert yourself with all of your womanly wiles without falling into those masculine streotypes. good read. great insight into the male mind and male/female business dynamic. 
one of the tidbits of information that stayed with me was something to the effect that even in a relaxed state, men have recurring themes of sex and agression coursing through their minds.  poor fellows can shut it off. explains a lot.
well that explains everything!!! of course...i guess i always had an idea that were the case! hahahhaha!!! (sorry guys)
i will have to look into that book. i read another one that was similar in theme to that...and at the moment...i apologize...i can`t put my finger around the name of it. i can see it on my bookcase at the moment in my head and can`t see the title. anyway...there are a couple of others that i really like:
10 stupid things women do to mess up their lives by laura schlessinger
the third shift by michele kremen bolton
how to say it: for women by phyllis mindell
all of them are great reads. amazon has an entire section on business books for women in business....worth checking it out!.
a lot of people on sun have recommended purple cow by seth godin. 
i`m reading it right now and finding that it`s full of outrageous, unconventional wisdom. 
what are your thoughts about the book? are you applying the message to your product / business?.
i thought the the big moo was a great read. sometimes people drive to go into business, but forget what makes them different, and what could make their concept or product exciting..
i haven`t read this particular book, no, but i would highly recommend the few ebooks he has out there (for free!). as the founder of squidoo, he has some interesting takes on marketing and where the web is going. i often read his advice on these things, as he seems to spend all day long just getting inside the average web user`s head.thanks for the book rec ... maybe i can smash some time in my life to actually read something! (or maybe i`ll just hire someone to read it for me and give me the cliff notes. ).
maybe we could build a forum topic like that one on brand-building? how to be different, or something like that.
think of all the people who want a web critique. mostly, it`s the same
problems over and over. but that`s the nature of people...to tend to
conform. so entrepreneurs would want to be different, and end up
conforming to the same problems, over and over.
why is that? is it because being an entrepreneur puts a person into a
capsule where they don`t have the time or freedom to compare their
product with the "rest of the world?" sun is a great place, in that
respect, where everyone is an entrepreneur, so the focus isn`t on
"gosh...how cool that you`re starting a business!"
i haven`t read the book either, and would love to hear some examples.
what`s the difference between being different in a "good" way, versus
"bad" way?
